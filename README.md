# PyLearners
## An Awarding Winning App in the Congressional App Challenge 

## About PyLearners
PyLearners was created to bridge the gap many beginner programmers face after learning the basics of Python, when tutorials
end but real-world practice feels out of reach. The platform addresses this challenge by offering interactive, game-inspired
learning experiences that encourage users to continue developing their skills. One highlight is a Wordle-like game
where players guess Python libraries based on brief descriptions. This not only reinforces recognition of useful libraries, 
but sparkes a curiosity to explore them more. Our next game is Pythonle that combines puzzle-solving with hands-on coding 
challenges, allowing users to test their code against multiple cases. PyLearners helps users stay motivated and engaged, 
making it easier to grow as a Python programmer.
